## Usage Instructions

1. **Duplicate this template** for each new video project
2. **Fill in each section** with specific details for your video
3. **Add or remove scenes** as needed for your content
4. **Use the checklist** to track production progress
5. **Share with team members** for collaboration

## Tips for Video Game Content

- **Show gameplay early** to hook viewers interested in the game
- **Balance explanation with demonstration** - don't just talk, show the concepts
- **Use timestamps** for longer videos to help viewers navigate
- **Include on-screen text** for key concepts and terminology
- **Consider your audience's knowledge level** - explain terms that may be unfamiliar
- **Capture high-quality footage** at the resolution you'll export
- **Plan B-roll** for talking head segments
- **Script transitions** between different game concepts or examples

## Example Video Concepts

This template works great for videos about:
- Game mechanics explanations
- Level design analysis
- Game theory and systems
- Tutorial and how-to content
- Game reviews and critiques
- Development process documentation
- Speedrun strategies
- Comparison videos

## Version Control Best Practices

When working on video game projects and storyboards, following proper version control practices is essential for collaboration and maintaining project history.

### Git Workflows

#### Git Flow
Git Flow is a branching model that provides a robust framework for managing larger projects:
- **Main branches:** `main` (production-ready) and `develop` (integration branch)
- **Supporting branches:** feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches
- **Best for:** Projects with scheduled releases and multiple versions in production
- **Benefits:** Clear separation between development and production code, organized release management

#### Trunk-Based Development
Trunk-based development emphasizes frequent integration to a single main branch:
- **Main branch:** All developers commit to `main` (or `trunk`) frequently
- **Short-lived branches:** Feature branches exist for no more than a day or two
- **Best for:** Teams practicing continuous integration and deployment
- **Benefits:** Reduced merge conflicts, faster feedback loops, simplified workflow

### General Best Practices
- **Commit often** with clear, descriptive messages
- **Use meaningful branch names** that describe the feature or fix
- **Review code** before merging to maintain quality
- **Keep commits atomic** - each commit should represent a single logical change
- **Write good commit messages** following the conventional format (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- **Use `.gitignore`** to exclude generated files and sensitive data
- **Tag releases** to mark important milestones in your project
